Gube Roldberg
=============

Gube Roldberg was originally a physics based game created for CSC335 at the University of Arizona. After completion of the coruse, many project required features were stripped out with the ultimate goal of refining the underlying 2d physics and collision engines and repurposing them for broader usage. Development ended as of 2011.

Programmed by Duncan Krassikoff and Mark Ross.
